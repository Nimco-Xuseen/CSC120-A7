- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
In the Library class, I overloaded the addTitle method. One version accepts just the title of the book, while another takes both the title and an author. This allows users to add books to the collection with varying levels of detail, enhancing functionality.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
 The overloading of addTitle streamlined adding books with different information requirements.Managing the interaction between overloaded methods sometimes led to confusion, particularly when specifying parameters. Always document your methods clearly to avoid misunderstandings, especially with overloaded methods.
